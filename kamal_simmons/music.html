          Kamal started his musical journey with his Dad Sadeeq. Sadeeq
          immigrated to the US in the early 2000s, and was a big fan of rock
          music ever since. He especially loved Guns n' Roses, and Kamal grew up
          listening to a lot of it. Because of this, Kamal had a liking to
          guitar at a young age. When Kamal's grandfather, Will, found out about
          this, he pulled out his old guitar from his closet. He had never
          learned to play it, and offered to take Kamal to guitar lessons if he
          promised to work hard to learn the instrument.

        <p class="music-p2">
          Kamal also took piano lessons for a few weeks during this time, but
          saw piano only as a side-hobby, and elected to focus on learning his
          favorite instrument.

        <p class="music-p3">
          In middle school band, however, guitar was not an instrument option.
          Instead, Kamal opted for percussion, as he could not figure out how to
          play brass or wind isntruments at the time. This turned out to be a
          great decision for him. He made it all the way to second place in the
          All-State Band Championship of Washington State in the group "Stick
          People."
        </p>
        <p class="music-p4">
          Even though Kamal thoroughly enjoyed his time as a percussionist, his
          main instrument remains the guitar. He bought a violin in early 2022,
          but has not spent much time on it.
