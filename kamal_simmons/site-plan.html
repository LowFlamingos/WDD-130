      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I will provide you with an easy-to-access website that has more information about Kamal 
        than any other website, article, or source out there. This website seeks to shed a 
        little bit of light on his previously untold story.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The target audience for my website is any individual who wishes to learn more about 
        Kamal Simmons. People will likely access my website through the computer, but it 
        should be formatted to run on all devices.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will provide general information about Kamal as well as images that, when clicked, will take the user to the represented child page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        People will come to my site because it has more information about Kamal Simmons than any other accessible source does. It will have information about 
        his musical interest, school and work experiences, and future plans. Some topics that would be interesting to have for the music page are how he got 
        into music. The school and work page could have information about his past and current school and work experiences as well as some of his future plans. 
        The plans page could have some goals he is working towards, goals he hopes to reach, and his plans for reaching his goals.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Kamal started his musical journey with his Dad Sadeeq. Sadeeq immigrated to the US in the early 2000s, and was a big fan of rock music ever since. 
        He especially loved Guns n' Roses, and Kamal grew up listening to a lot of it. Because of this, Kamal had a liking to guitar at a young age. When 
        his grandfather Will found out about this, Will pulled out his old guitar from his closet. He had never learned to play it, and offered to take Kamal 
        to guitar lessons if he promised to work hard to learn the instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
        In middle school band, however, guitar was not an instrument option. Instead, Kamal opted for percussion, as he could not figure out how to play 
        brass or wind isntruments at the time. This turned out to be a great decision for him, as he made it all the way to second place in the All-State 
        Band Championship of Washington State in the group "Stick People."
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Kamal thoroughly enjoyed his time as a percussionist, his main instrument remains the guitar. He bought a violin in early 2022, but has 
        not spent much time on it.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>School and Work</h3>
      <p>
        Kamal had an unusual school experience from an early age. In kindergarten, his teacher noticed that he was bored with some of the learning material, 
        and tested him on the material of next year. He showed that he had already learned the content of 1st grade, and was told to skip the grade and go 
        straight to second. He continued classes normally until he was asked to take an I.Q. test. Little did he know, this test was to decide which kids 
        would be selected for the Highly-Capable Program. He was sent to another school to participate in the program in 5th and 6th grade.
      </p>
      <p>
        His high school life was fairly normal, but he took classes at South Puget Sound Community College for his second half through the Running Start 
        program. He was then accepted into the University of Washington - Tacoma Campus, studying Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences online. He is on track 
        to graduate with his Bachelor's degree at nineteen years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kamal worked as a bagger at  Fred Meyer during 2021 to pay for college. He worked his way up to the Electronics Department, but the pay was not much 
        better than in his last position. Because of this, among other reasons, he ended up leaving Fred Meyer and joining Cellular Sales, an authorized Verizon 
        dealer.
